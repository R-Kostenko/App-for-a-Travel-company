# Application for a Travel company
Application for a travel company, created in Windows Froms using Microsoft SQL Server Management 18. Fully commented, without installer.

This is my first relatively large-scale pet project, which I made in a short period of time as a result of an assignment given by universities for a summer internship. It is developed as a desktop application for viewing and ordering tours, as well as administering tours and users. Unfortunately, at least for now, I have not implemented remote access to my database, so the application has no installer - you will have to have a code editor (e.g. Microsoft Visual Studio) and a local database (e.g. Microsoft SQL Server Management 18). Instructions for configuring the application to work on your computer will of course be provided.
